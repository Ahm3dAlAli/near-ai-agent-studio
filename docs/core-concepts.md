# Core Concepts

## Overview

NEAR Swarm Intelligence is a framework for building AI-powered multi-agent systems that can collaborate to make intelligent decisions. The framework leverages large language models (LLMs) through the Hyperbolic API and integrates with the NEAR blockchain for secure and transparent operations.

## Key Components

### 1. Agents

Agents are autonomous entities that can:
- Process information using LLMs
- Make decisions based on predefined criteria
- Collaborate with other agents
- Execute actions on the NEAR blockchain

#### Agent Types

1. **Market Analyzer**
   - Analyzes market data and trends
   - Identifies trading opportunities
   - Evaluates market conditions

2. **Risk Manager**
   - Assesses transaction risks
   - Enforces position limits
   - Validates proposals against risk parameters

3. **Strategy Optimizer**
   - Fine-tunes execution parameters
   - Optimizes timing and efficiency
   - Suggests strategy improvements

4. **Chat Assistant**
   - Provides natural language interface
   - Explains agent decisions
   - Helps users understand system capabilities

### 2. Swarm Intelligence

The swarm represents a collaborative decision-making system where:
- Multiple agents work together
- Consensus is required for actions
- Different expertise is combined
- Decisions are more robust

#### Consensus Mechanism

```python
class SwarmConsensus:
    def __init__(self, min_confidence=0.7, min_votes=2):
        self.min_confidence = min_confidence
        self.min_votes = min_votes
    
    def evaluate(self, votes):
        if len(votes) < self.min_votes:
            return False
            
        confidence = sum(v['confidence'] for v in votes) / len(votes)
        return confidence >= self.min_confidence
```

### 3. Market Integration

The framework provides tools for:
- Real-time price data
- Volume analysis
- Order book depth
- Historical trends

#### Example Market Data Flow

```python
class MarketDataManager:
    async def get_market_context(self, symbol):
        return {
            "price": await self.get_price(symbol),
            "volume": await self.get_volume(symbol),
            "trend": await self.get_trend(symbol),
            "depth": await self.get_order_book(symbol)
        }
```

### 4. Natural Language Processing

The framework uses LLMs to:
- Process natural language commands
- Generate human-readable explanations
- Provide market insights
- Handle complex queries

#### Example NLP Flow

```python
class NLPProcessor:
    async def process_query(self, query):
        # Convert natural language to structured command
        command = await self.parse_command(query)
        
        # Execute command
        result = await self.execute_command(command)
        
        # Generate natural language response
        response = await self.generate_response(result)
        
        return response
```

### 5. Risk Management

Built-in risk controls include:
- Position size limits
- Loss thresholds
- Exposure monitoring
- Emergency shutdown

#### Example Risk Check

```python
class RiskManager:
    async def check_risk(self, proposal):
        # Check position size
        if proposal.size > self.max_position_size:
            return False, "Position size exceeds limit"
            
        # Check potential loss
        if proposal.potential_loss > self.max_loss:
            return False, "Potential loss too high"
            
        return True, "Risk checks passed"
```

## Best Practices

1. **Agent Design**
   - Keep agents focused on specific tasks
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Use appropriate confidence thresholds
   - Log important decisions

2. **Swarm Configuration**
   - Start with small swarms (2-3 agents)
   - Test consensus mechanisms thoroughly
   - Monitor agent performance
   - Adjust thresholds based on results

3. **Risk Management**
   - Always implement position limits
   - Use emergency shutdown mechanisms
   - Monitor exposure continuously
   - Log all risk-related decisions

4. **Development Flow**
   - Start on testnet
   - Use small test transactions
   - Monitor agent behavior
   - Gradually increase complexity

## Security Considerations

1. **API Keys**
   - Store securely in environment variables
   - Never commit to version control
   - Rotate regularly
   - Use minimal required permissions

2. **Transaction Safety**
   - Implement transaction limits
   - Use testnet for development
   - Verify transaction parameters
   - Monitor execution results

3. **Error Handling**
   - Graceful failure modes
   - Proper cleanup procedures
   - Comprehensive logging
   - Alert mechanisms
